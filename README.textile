h1. OMD Vagrant Lab

**NOTE: THE MODULES STORED IN THIS PROJECT ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIMENTAL. USE AT YOU OWN RISK!**

h2. Purpose

The purpose of this lab is to built and test out omd and nagios related puppet code for production use. This should allow for a clean and reproducable environment to develop on

h2. Structure

 * Vagrantfile - Main file that describes each of the VMs to be deployed
 * manifests - Puppet manifests. Files in the root are only used on first boot; nodes/*.pp are persistenly applied.
 * modules - Puppet modules for puppet, omd, nagios and epel.
 * epel.repo - Hack to allow puppet to have epel repo packages

h2. Getting started

 # Install the latest Vagrant package for your system
 # vagrant up

h2. VMs

 * puppet.example.com - Central puppet server that deploys node catalogs. Required for nagios exported resource collections
 * poller1.example.com - Gearman worker/poller. Performs passive/active checks for collector
 * poller2.example.com - Gearman worker/poller. Performs passive/active checks for collector
 * collector.example.com - Main nagios server. Collects information from the pollers

h2. Features

 * N-way redundancy for poller servers
 * single port usage for all environment ACLs
 * Variable monitoring core: Icinca/Nagios
 * Multiple OMD site management
 * Workload distribution by hostgroup
 * Helper classes to simplify end host monitoring (Check_MK + nagios objects)
